# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Dataset-Analysis
## 📂Project Background
Sleep is essential. Good sleep affects everything we do—how we think, our mood, and our long-term health, including heart and metabolism. Since many people worldwide struggle with sleep problems like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, it is crucial to understand what causes them.
In this project, I analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset to uncover patterns and risk factors associated with various sleep outcomes. Using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for data visualization, the project aims to provide a clear and data-driven understanding of how demographic, lifestyle, and health conditions contribute to an individual's sleep profile.

## 💡 Data Structure and Overview
In this analysis, I used a dataset on Sleep Health and Lifestyle, containing 374 entries with comprehensive information gathered from various individuals. This dataset is designed to explore the complex interplay between daily habits, professional life, and physiological health as they relate to sleep quality and disorders.
key variables include:
Person ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Daily Steps and Sleep Disorder.

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This analysis underscores that sleep health is an integrated outcome of lifestyle choices, stress management, and underlying health status. The project reveals that achieving optimal Sleep Duration and Quality of Sleep is deeply rooted in a combination of behavioural and physiological risk factors.
